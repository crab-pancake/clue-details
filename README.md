# Clue Details

This plugin provides additional details and overlays for clue scrolls. This can be particularly useful when juggling clues or for snowflake ironmen who can only do particular subsets of clues, allowing them to ignore ones they can't do.

**NOTE**: This plugin will only work for beginner and master clues after you have read them once. After that, the plugin should keep track of them as long as they are in your inventory, dropped by you, or banked.

## Marked Clues

There are configurable filter lists you can set up to enable highlighting of clues you've chosen. Use filters in the sidebar to easily find the clues you're interested in highlighting.

As the hints appear if you hover over the menu option for a clue, it can make it easier to identify which clue is which in a big stack of clues.

## Overlays

The "Show hover text" toggle will provide an infobox letting you know the step's details when you hover over a clue scroll.

## Other Plugins

On its own, Clue Details is unable to identify individual Hot Cold clue steps, and instead will provide a single hint for all.

However, if you have the [Hot Cold Helper](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/hot-cold-helper) plugin installed, Hot Cold clue steps will be automatically identified once you have solved the Hot Cold location.
