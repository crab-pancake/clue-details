# Clue Details

This plugin provides details on clue scrolls whilst they're on the floor. When you hover over a clue scroll, you'll get an infobox letting you know the step's details. This can be particularly useful for snowflake ironmen who can only do particular subsets of clues, allowing them to ignore ones they can't do.

**NOTE**: This does not work for beginner or master clues.

There is also configurable filter lists you can set up to enable highlighting of clues you've chosen. Use filters in the sidebar to easily find the clues you're interested in highlighting.

You can also easily mark and unmark clues by shift-clicking one already on the floor or in your inventory.

As the hints appear if you hover over the menu option for a clue, it can make it easier to identify which clue is which in a big stack of clues.

As an optional toggle in the plugin's settings, you can also make it so the actual text of the clue item is adjusted, so you don't even need to hover for details.

## Editing clue hints

You can also edit the clue hints shown to you. In the sidebar, right-click the clue hint you want to change. Input the next text you want shown for it, and then submit. It will now be what is shown to you for the specific clue.
